      "response": " Step 1: Determine the amount of white fiber needed.\nThe problem states that the robe takes half as much white fiber as blue fiber. Since the robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber, we can calculate the amount of white fiber needed as follows:\nWhite fiber = (1/2) * Blue fiber\nWhite fiber = (1/2) * 2\nWhite fiber = 1 bolt\n\nStep 2: Calculate the total number of bolts needed.\nNow that we know the robe requires 2 bolts of blue fiber and 1 bolt of white fiber, we can add these amounts together to find the total number of bolts needed:\nTotal bolts = Blue fiber + White fiber\nTotal bolts = 2 + 1\nTotal bolts = 3\n\nFinal answer: It takes a total of 3 bolts to make the robe.
